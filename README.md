# DocChain

Like Google Docs, this program provides a blockchain-based documentation-sharing App.

1. Implemeneted by Qt, OpenSSL and asynchronous libevent on Xcode.

2. Decentralized distributed database and incorruptible chain.

3. Real-time reaction from network nodes' modification.

4. Cross-platform framework with iOS/Android Apps and desktop application.

5. Includes following features: "Publish Public Key", "Publish Address", "Sign Network Protocol", "Verify Remote Block", and "Code Documentation Modification."

# Overview
![alt text](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13886288/34879252-8f536788-f7e7-11e7-8dd2-e660f6480f92.png)


1. Block name input: Input a new block name (space is NOT allowed)

2. Block validation status

    "Validating...": The new block is under validating by other nodes

    "+1": The new block is already validated OK by 1 node

    "OK!" : The new block is already validated OK by N nodes (In this version, N = 2)

3. Local address: Identity of this device

4. Blockchain list: Show current blockchain list, from latest to oldest

5. Debugging status: Show some network protocols and useful messages

# Functionality

[Publish Public Key]

    Once the program is launched, public/private key pairs will be generated by ECC (Elliptic-curve cryptography) secp521r1 algorithm.

    Then, REMOTE_COMMAND_REPLY_PUBKEY and GET_PUBKEY will be broadcast by following format:

        REMOTE_COMMAND_REPLY_PUBKEY NodeAddress PublicKeyPlainFormat
        GET_PUBKEY

    When other nodes received neighbor's public key, this public key will be stored in a hash table with (key, value) = (NodeAddress, PublicKey).

    When other nodes received "GET_PUBKEY", its public key will be sent back by:
    
        REMOTE_COMMAND_REPLY_PUBKEY NodeAddress PublicKeyPlainFormat

[Publish Address]

    After public key is generated, address is then generated by RIPEMD160(SHA256(PublicKeyPlainFormat)).

    The address will be used inside network protocol.

[Sign Network Protocol]

    Here is network protocol:

        [BLOCKCHAIN_HEADER][ADDRESS][MessageLen][Message][Signature]
            BLOCKCHAIN_HEADER(strlen(BLOCKCHAIN_HEADER)): "__ThisIsBlockChainPacketByClarkYang__", to avoid conflicting to other network packets
            Address(40): Identify the user of this protocol
            MessageLen(4): (0000 ~ FFFF) Indicate message length
            Message(MessageLen): Transferred message
            Signature(-) : Message signature

    On sender node, message signature will be generated by the private key before sending.

    On receiver node, signature will be verified by the public key of sender (should already stored in hash table).
    
    Only the verified message will be executed; otherwise it'll be dropped.

[Verify Remote Block]

    When a node modifies the documentation, it will add a new block to the tail of its blockchain.
    
    Then, this new block will be broadcast to request other nodes to add this new block (modification).

    When a node received a remote block, it will verify if this block is valid with current blockchain.

    Following criterias must be met before adding to current blockchain:

    1. Remote block's index = current blockchain's latest index + 1
    2. Remote block's previous hash = current blockchain's latest hash
    3. Remote block's hash = SHA256(blockIndex, previousHash, timeStamp, modifyCode)

    If everything went well, this remote block will be added to the tail of current blockchain.

[Code Documentation Modification]

    Here is the coding format of documentation modification:

        [MODE][POS][MODIFICATION]
            MODE(1): '+' (Add a character), '-' (Remove a character)
            POS(4): (0000 ~ FFFF) Indicate modification position
            MODIFICATION(-): Modification word(s)

    Normally, when user add a character from GUI, the add command will be broadcast.

    For example, "+003Fb" will be sent when character 'b' is inserted to position 3F(63 in decimal).

    Similar, when user remove a character from GUI, the remove command (ex. -003Fx) will be broadcast.

    Besides, if verifying remote block failed, we might ask for remote blockchain and replace the current one.

    In this situation, every blocks will be exeucted one-by-one, to re-construct the same paragraph as remote node.
